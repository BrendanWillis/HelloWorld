## Overview

**Project Title**:
HelloWorld

**Project Description**:
A quick and easy demonstration of HelloWorld using Python print function

**Project Goals**:
To complete an assignment
To comunicate the appropriate greeting 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Determine storage options: 
    Create a new folder to hold all the material that we will go over and separate projects that we will create.

2. Determine the Language: 
    We need to create a HelloWorld program, and out of the myriad of options, we will go for a simplistic approach and use Python.

3. Using the Python "Print" function type "Hello World"

4. Run program 

Instructions for using the software:

1. Usually, the handling of a python can cause distress for those unfamiliar with snakes. However, since this is just a programming language, you can rest easy
2. The "Print" function returns a string of text, in our case it will return Hello World in the terminal.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Have a computer 
* Press power button 
* Use text editor, Visual Studio code is fine
* Attend Applied Programming
